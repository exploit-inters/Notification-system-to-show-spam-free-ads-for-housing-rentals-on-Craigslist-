You literally can't get closer to Runyon. Apartment is on the 2nd floor facing Fuller Ave. So let's start with the negatives and get those out of the way: It's LOUD in the morning (if you're like me and like to sleep with the sliding door open (it slides open to a small balcony). So if noise bothers you in the morning, this place isn't for you. Second negative, It's pretty dark in the apartment, not a lot of light gets through to the living room and kitchen. Your room gets sun since it opens to the balcony. Now to all the positives! -Right by Runyon -Gym in building, with dry sauna, open 24 hours -Pool and hot tub on the roof, heated year round + BBQ and amazing 360 views of LA, open 8am-10pm -Right by the heart of Hollywood and easy access to WEHO and the 101. -Parking spot (dual parking so kind of pain but we leave each other's spare keys in cars) -Apartment was newly renovated when we moved in 2 years ago so it's nice inside. -Wood flooring in common areas and carpet in bedrooms -Gas fireplace (for show, doesn't really heat much but looks nice) -Decent sized walk in closet -AC & central heating -Everything is furnished, except your room. -Rooms are on opposite ends from each other with living room in between. -60 inch plasma + apple tv in living room -Laundry rooms on each floor, they take cards that you can refill online or in the machine in the lobby -Right up the hill from Rock n' Roll Ralph's, open 24 hours. -I'm awesome lol A little about me: I'm a video editor and writer. I work from home (in my room) so would rather someone who has a 9-5 or isn't always home. In the spring, summer, and fall I hit up Runyon 3 or 4 times a week. I try to hit up the beach weekly in the summer but that doesn't always happen. Diverse group of friends, some in the restaurant/bar industry, some in the entertainment industry, and others with corporate type jobs. What I'm looking for: -Non smoker (cigarettes, weed is ok, unless you smoke 24/7) (it's a non smoking building) -Cleanliness! I'm a bit OCD in the sense I like my place clean! If you're messy or a slob, we aren't a fit! -Professional, mid 20s and up -Someone who isn't going to party every night, or bring the party home, or have a boyfriend/girlfriend over every night. I'm very respectful of shared spaces. Looking for the same! -No couples, pets, or children! Rent is $1350 plus utilities (gas/water/electric & internet) usually between $100 and $200. Deposit is $300. We are month to month so no obligation to stay, but you will need to sign onto the lease. You can check the website for the building here to see more images https://www.pinnacleaptsla.com If it seems like we will be a good fit, come over and check out the place and we can take it from there! Look forward to meeting you! Also, please send an email or text with a little bit about yourself, I'm getting too many random texts just asking if the room is open!

Hey there future roommate - please make sure you send your email address, social media stuff and contact number in your message! The house is IDEAL FOR an actor/dancer/artist! - $750.00 per month - MONTH TO MONTH - NO LEASE - No Credit Check - No Lease - Deposit of $400 CHECK ALL OF YOUR OTHER PLACES AND THEN COME HERE, BECAUSE HERE IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE! This is a super-clean, safe, fun and positive living environment. Everyone asks, ""so what do I get at the Artist House that the other same-style houses don't have?"" Here's what you get when you become our roommate: 1. Free Laundry and dryer - Including premium detergent and fabric softener. 2. Paper towels and toilet paper (only premium products for the house) completely supplied. 3. Premium Coffee and sugar for the house. 4. Printer & Scanner with paper and ink completely supplied. 5. Driveway or Street parking in front of the house... Never deal with tickets, street cleaning or carrying groceries far! 6. Daily housekeeping. 7. Premium movie channels, On-Demand & DVR in both living rooms on BIG-SCREEN HD TVs. 8. High-Speed Google WiFi throughout the entire house. 9. Filtered drinking water. This is a positive environment for artists to start out, grow, thrive and make new connections. Many of the people that live here, or have lived here, have been moving forward in the movie industry and almost all of us attend acting classes. If you think that you would be a great fit then contact me ASAP and let's get you over to see the place. THE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY FURNISHED!! (Full Kitchenware, Pillows / Sheets for the Beds....etc.) so all you need to bring is your personal belongings and clothes to move right in !! It's a wonderful, spacious house in a gorgeous and safe neighborhood in North Hollywood. It's a ten minute walk to the Metro -- one of the best public transit systems in the United States. There are two bedrooms on one side of the house and two on the other. The girls have their bedrooms on one side and the guys have their bedrooms on the other side. There are two large living areas to hang out or find time to be alone. Everyone here is supportive and it's a great place to be to create a foundation in the entertainment industry. The ideal person is an artist that gets along well with other artists. If you are coming in from out of state, then I recommend flying into Burbank Airport - It's a few miles from the house. You must be neat, clean and get along with artistic people. This is not a party house. Drug users are not welcome here! No cannabis use on the property. If drinking is a big part of your life, this isn't the place for you. Email us ASAP as space is limited and please send an introduction and social media links, etc. actors actor actors dancer dancers screenwriter apartment hostel room dorm reality show artist artists

Garage Antique Stove,$2100,24.0,,apartment,"Hi there. My name is Lori. Richard and I are the owners of a totally charming and hip vintage 5 unit apartment building in Westchester, California. This apartment gets amazing light and an amazing cross-breeze. It has windows on all sides which let in light and cross breezes. I just purchased gorgeous window treatments for the living room large window and the kitchen. The apartment has new custom widow treatments throughout consisting of (wooden shades, woven shades, and fabric window treatments. The apartment comes with a garage with an electric clicker for one car and extra storage in the garage This apartment is very unusual and very charming. We recently renovated it with great attention to detail and it really shows. It is an upstairs one bedroom one bathroom unit with no common walls with any other apartments. The bath features a standing shower and a separate porcelain bath tub. The charming formal dining room (which has a pretty big window in it) features French doors. It is off the kitchen. Some of my tenants have used this room as an office or as a den / computer / television room. Of course, you can use it as a dining room! There is a laundry room next to the garage with storage in it for your laundry detergent and similar items. This unit features a brand new Spanish tile kitchen floor with various different Mexican hand painted deco tiles. Sage green cabinets with oil rubbed bronze cabinet hardware. A brand new large capacity refrigerator...a vintage stove from the 50's with a center griddle...the kind you have always dreamed of! There is a front door and a back door with a small porch. The apartment comes with an electric garage with room for one car. The white ceramic vintage tile kitchen counters are in excellent condition. The light fixtures in the entire unit are new but look old, mostly with oil rubbed bronze finishes. The light in the bedroom is a chandelier with glass drops, new but made to look old. The formal dining room features an original vintage chandelier with glass drops and two louvered doors if you wish to close the dining room off. All of the door knobs and cabinet hardware and bathroom towel rods and toilet paper holders, etc. are oil rubbed bronze. The bathroom has a brand new but vintage looking ceramic floor tile with deco tiles. There is vintage porcelain bath tub and a separate tiled shower. There is a large closet in the living room and also in the hall are large built in cabinets and several large drawers. All of the window treatments are custom. Some are Roman Woven Shades, louvered wooden shades (in a wood tone) and some are tapestry/damask long curtain panels. The paint colors are custom mixed in a taupe color with white trim in most of the apt. with a gorgeous sage green in the kitchen. The rest of the apartment is gorgeous vintage hardwood floor which were recently refinished. The living room is very large and it features a huge picture window and another window on the side. The building is very quiet and one of my tenants has lived there for close to 40 years! You can even garden and plant flowers and/or veges if you wish. I do provide a gardener, of course! The apt. has the ambiance of a California Bungalow House rather than an apt. There is a front and a back entrance. Feel free to call me to ask any questions. I am always very responsive to any tenant questions or concerns that may arise. The tenant is only moving out because he got an amazing job offer in Seattle. At most, the apartment will need some cleaning , paint touch up, and minor repairs and then it will be move in ready. A cat is okay with a deposit and I will consider a small dog. I will amend this listing to add more details as they come into my mind. This is an unusual apartment that has been lovingly renovated. I spend more money on fixtures and decorating than most landlords as I don't care for cheap materials or fixtures. There is a laundry room next to the garage as well with cabinets for your laundry detergent and other items. I will post more pictures soon. That's it for now.

El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is a vibrant new residential rental community offering the best of city living in central Hollywood. Steps away from the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine (and the Metro station), the property offers a range of smart and flexible layouts to suit every personality. Studios, lofts, bungalows, penthouses, and classic one- and two-bedroom apartments are available. Acclaimed L.A.-based creative collective Commune Design created El Centro's thoughtfully crafted interiors to feature large windows, high ceilings, walk-in closets, and honed surfaces that aren't too shiny. The urbane El Centro lifestyle centers on the pool, lounge, yoga studio, spa, and fitness center. Passageways and courtyards burst with drought-sensitive landscaping of exotic palms, wild succulents, and specimen cacti from L.A.'s Cactus Store. The project's name, by the way, comes from El Centro Avenue. Going back much further, the root word centrum originally meant the fixed point around which you draw a circle--the middle of it all. With its center-of-everything location, El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is designed to be your new walkable, car-optional, app-enabled, indoor/outdoor, live-work home in the city.

But we have created a jewel of a one bedroom apartment that has the open feeling of a loft right in the heart of Beverly Hills. This apartment was remodeled by taking it down to the studs, opening up every wall, raising the ceiling as high as we could, replacing every window and door, and giving you a brand new apartment in every way. When you first walk in the front door, you notice right away that the ceilings are higher than any you will find in this area, and they are filled with LED lights that bathe the entire area. A rich laminate flooring has been installed throughout the living room and into the bedroom, and the walls are painted in custom colors. The living room flows right into the open kitchen with brand new cabinets, quartz countertops, tiled backsplash and floors, stainless appliances including refrigerator, gas stove, and dishwasher, and includes a large island cabinet with its own electric outlet and an overhang that extends into a sitting area for informal dining. Your own private washer and dryer sit behind the door allowing you convenience and privacy for your washing needs. The bedroom is nicely sized and includes a mirrored door closet with additional storage space above it, LED lights, along with a fan and CAT6 wiring for your TV to supplement the CAT6 outlet in the living room. The bathroom has been fully tiled on every wall creating a luxury you would find in the richest home in Beverly Hills. The brand new windows are not only beautiful and functional, they are also designed to deaden all the outside noise of the city for that sense of quiet and solitude. And if you want to keep them closed, we have air conditioning and custom window shades for every window that add the final details of high end contemporary living. One parking space is included with your apartment. Best of all, you have US, private owners who clearly care deeply about this building and about taking care of you in a professional manner.

However, we will not be sharing a living room, kitchen, or any other common areas of the house other than the foyer and staircase. Your living area is your own private sanctuary, as is mine. My bedroom is located upstairs as well, but the childrens' bedrooms are downstairs, so you will rarely hear them. I will always respect your privacy and your right to a quiet living environment, but if we end up becoming friends and mutually decide to hang out together, then I'm good with that too. I'm one of those people who always has a positive attitude with a smile on my face :) If interested, please reply via email and tell me a bit about yourself, your lifestyle, and your employment, and also please include a photo of yourself.

The Perch Apartments is a brand new community close to restaurants, shops, and bars along Colorado Blvd. and York Blvd. Charming, walkable shopping streets and shady residential blocks make Eagle Rock and its sister neighborhood, Highland Park, feel like a small-town oasis within the city. This part of Los Angeles is known for residential pockets flush with old trees and cozy family homes. At The Perch, you're steps away from the two main-drag shopping streets that characterize the area. On Colorado Blvd, you'll find old-school restaurants and delis that have made their name here for decades selling pastrami sandwiches, classic hamburgers, and some of the city's best (cheap) pizza. York, like a vein running through the heart of Highland Park, is chock-full of fledgling new businesses like coffee shops and specialty food stores, catering to the community's younger crowd. It's all so quaint, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that you're only 20 minutes from the dynamic urban energy of Downtown Los Angeles, and even fewer from the charming, old-town vibes of Pasadena.

El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is a vibrant new residential rental community offering the best of city living in central Hollywood. Steps away from the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine (and the Metro station), the property offers a range of smart and flexible layouts to suit every personality. Studios, lofts, bungalows, penthouses, and classic one- and two-bedroom apartments are available.

The urbane El Centro lifestyle centers on the pool, lounge, yoga studio, spa, and fitness center. Passageways and courtyards burst with drought-sensitive landscaping of exotic palms, wild succulents, and specimen cacti from L.A.'s Cactus Store. The project's name, by the way, comes from El Centro Avenue. Going back much further, the root word centrum originally meant the fixed point around which you draw a circle--the middle of it all. With its center-of-everything location, El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is designed to be your new walkable, car-optional, app-enabled, indoor/outdoor, live-work home in the city.
